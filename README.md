# Global Agricultural Food Systems Analysis  
Production, Food Security & Strategic Outlook (2015–2029)  

A reproducible agricultural intelligence warehouse and policy‑grade analytics pipeline built from FAO (FAOSTAT) data. The objective is to transform raw FAO exports into economic, food‑security, and strategic insights using a full data‑engineering and econometric workflow. The output is a single AI‑ready analytical model supporting monitoring, diagnostics, forecasting and prescriptive policy analysis.

End‑to‑end pipeline
FAO → Excel → SQL Server → SPSS → Python (Google Colab) → Power BI → Quadratic AI

---

## Executive summary 
This project converts FAO long‑format tables into canonical fact tables and a single `Full_dataset` master view. That view is the system of record for:
- food‑security monitoring,
- productivity and efficiency analysis,
- trade dependency and risk assessment,
- loss & waste diagnostics,
- policy and investment planning.

Analytical truth is governed in SQL Server; SPSS, Python and Power BI consume SQL outputs for diagnostics, forecasting and visualization. Quadratic AI is used for exploratory AI‑assisted analytics and scenario experiments — always validated against SQL outputs.

## Data pipeline (high level)
FAO Database  
↓ Excel (initial extraction, reconciliation, cleaning)  
↓ CSV export  
↓ SQL Server (SSMS) — warehouse construction & QA  
↓ SPSS — statistical diagnostics  
↓ Python (Google Colab) — predictive & prescriptive modeling  
↓ Power BI — visualization & dashboards  
↓ Quadratic AI — exploratory AI‑assisted analytics

Notes
- Excel is for early inspection and small, documented fixes only. SQL Server stores canonical datasets and enforces reproducible transforms.

## Datasets integrated
| Dataset | What it measures |
|---|---|
| production | Crop & livestock output, yield, harvested area |
| production_indices | Gross & per‑capita production indices (GPI, PCPI) |
| value_agriculture | Economic value of production (constant USD) |
| food_balance | Food supply, calories, protein, fat, losses |
| SUA | Trade flows, stocks, population |

These cover production, economics, nutrition and trade and are merged into the master analytical model.

---

## Warehouse architecture (SQL Server)
Raw FAO tables (long format) → summary fact tables → `Full_dataset` master view.

Raw tables:
- production, production_indices, value_agriculture, food_balance, SUA

Fact tables (T‑SQL):
- production_summary  
- production_index_summary  
- value_agriculture_summary  
- food_balance_summary  
- supply_utilization_summary

Master view:
- `Full_dataset` — harmonized country × commodity × year rows with numeric analytical fields (production, yields, indices, value, nutrition, trade, losses, stocks, population).

---

**ETL & validation workflow**
1. Extract: FAOSTAT API or file downloads.  
2. Inspect / quick fixes: Excel — log every manual change.  
3. Export canonical CSVs to `/data/raw/` and `/data/clean/`.  
4. Load: BULK INSERT / SSIS into SQL Server staging.  
5. Transform: pivot Elements → columns, build fact tables with T‑SQL.  
6. Validate: row counts, null rates, totals vs FAO aggregates, per‑capita checks.  
7. Expose: materialized/indexed tables and views for BI/ML.

Best practices
- Keep raw exports immutable.  
- Use FAOSTAT numeric codes for joins.  
- Version control T‑SQL and notebooks.  
- Maintain a changelog for any Excel/manual fixes.

---

**Core SQL modeling patterns**
Pivot FAO element rows into analytic columns (example):

```sql
SELECT
  Area,
  Item,
  Year,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Element = 'Production' THEN Value ELSE 0 END) AS Production,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Element = 'Area harvested' THEN Value ELSE 0 END) AS Area_Harvested,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Element = 'Yield' THEN Value ELSE 0 END) AS Yield,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Element = 'Losses' THEN Value ELSE 0 END) AS Losses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Element = 'Imports' THEN Value ELSE 0 END) AS Imports,
  SUM(CASE WHEN Element = 'Exports' THEN Value ELSE 0 END) AS Exports
FROM raw_fao_table
GROUP BY Area, Item, Year;
```

Safe ratios:

```sql
(Losses / NULLIF(Production, 0)) * 100 AS Loss_Rate_Percent
```

Practical notes:
- Normalize currency to constant USD before aggregations.  
- Standardize units: tonnes, kg/ha, kcal/person/day.  
- Include automated ETL QA queries (row counts, min/max, null rates).

---

**What each fact table captures**
- production_summary: Production, Yield, Area_Harvested, Yield_Carcass  
- production_index_summary: Gross Production Index (GPI), Per Capita Production Index (PCPI)  
- value_agriculture_summary: Gross Production Value (constant USD)  
- food_balance_summary: Food_Quantity, kcal/protein/fat per capita, Losses, Imports/Exports  
- supply_utilization_summary: Imports, Exports, Stock_Variation, Population

These feed `Full_dataset` for modelling and dashboards.

---

**Example policy‑grade indicator**
Food Loss Rate (%) = (Losses / Production) × 100

SQL example:

```sql
SELECT
  ps.Area, ps.Item, ps.Year,
  ps.Production,
  fb.Losses,
  CASE WHEN ps.Production > 0 THEN (fb.Losses / ps.Production) * 100 ELSE NULL END AS Loss_Rate_pct
FROM production_summary ps
JOIN food_balance_summary fb
  ON ps.Area = fb.Area AND ps.Item = fb.Item AND ps.Year = fb.Year;
```

Use this to prioritize storage/cold‑chain investments where loss rates are highest.

---

## SPSS diagnostics 
Dataset: `Full production data.sav` (240 rows)

Key observations:
- Production and Losses: strongly right‑skewed.  
- Area_Harvested: bimodal (smallholder vs commercial).  
- Yield: relatively stable distribution.

Statistical guidance:
- Use Spearman correlations where distributions are non‑normal.
- Key correlations: Production ↔ Area_Harvested (≈ 0.75); Production ↔ Value (≈ 0.86); Production ↔ Losses (scale effect).

Regression highlights:
- Production model (R² ≈ 0.77): Area_Harvested and Losses are significant; Imports show negative association; Yield not always significant (land dominates).
- Food Quantity model (R² ≈ 0.50): Production and Losses important; Exports reduce domestic food quantity.
- Nutrition model (R² ≈ 0.93): kcal per capita driven by protein and fat availability.

---

## Python (Colab) panel modeling & ML
Panel: countries = USA, Brazil, France, India, Nigeria, Australia; commodities = Rice, Maize, Wheat, Milk; years = 2015–2024; balanced panel ≈ 200 obs.

Diagnostic correlations:
- Area harvested: 0.84  
- Production value: 0.86  
- Food quantity: 0.80  
- Losses: 0.69

Random Forest forecasting (example):
- R² ≈ 0.99 (test)  
- MAE ≈ 1.7M tonnes

Feature importance (typical):
1. Area_Harvested  
2. Gross Production Value  
3. Losses  
4. Country (India)  
5. Commodity (Rice)

Implication: production is highly predictable from land, value and loss signals — useful for scenario analysis and policy simulation.

---

**Key findings (2015–2024)**
- System is largely land‑driven: area explains much of production variance.  
- Yield gaps are large: USA ≈ 20,000 kg/ha vs Nigeria ≈ 2,000 kg/ha (≈10×).  
- Per‑capita production is declining in 2022–2024 — population growth outpaces production.  
- Trade concentration: USA dominates exports; Nigeria relies heavily on imports.  
- Losses: Nigeria exhibits Loss Rate 200–400% in some years — losses (including imported food) may exceed domestic production (critical red flag).  
- Reducing post‑harvest losses is often a faster, cheaper way to boost effective food supply than expanding farmland.

---

**Forecast outlook (2025–2029)**
(From validated Python/SPSS models)
- USA remains productivity leader; India remains scale leader.  
- Nigeria remains import‑dependent unless loss & yield interventions occur.  
- Australia shows acute climate/drought risk (GPI decline).  
- Global per‑capita availability will weaken if current trends continue.
